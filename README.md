# discordpinbot

## Usage
When started, the bot will look in working directory for a file named token.txt - this file should contain the bot token created from the discord developer portal

The only dependency the bot has is the discord.py library, which can be installed with

    pip install discord.py

After that, to connect the bot all you need to do is run it in your python interpreter
